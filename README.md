# My [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/April/) CSS
The template I use all comes from [@Bays](https://anilist.co/user/Bays) on AniList - (https://github.com/AlsoBays/Anilist-Css)

I've tweaked it a bunch and [here](https://github.com/pinkazoid/My-CSS/blob/main/CSS) is what it looks like currently. I update it everytime I change it. I'm a noob to the whole CSS thing so a lot of it comes from trial and error, but I'm slowly getting there. 

## Credits:
Other than Bays, I have [@ChriSenpai](https://anilist.co/user/ChriSenpai/), [@sundays](https://anilist.co/user/sundays/), [@Adaptz](https://anilist.co/user/Adaptz/), and [@Wing](https://anilist.co/user/Wing/) to thank for my CSS. ChriSenpai, sundays and Wing for some of the actual coding, and Adaptz for design inspiration (current CSS is different now though). Under my [Current CSS](https://github.com/pinkazoid/My-CSS/blob/main/Current%20CSS), I left notes to show which of the coding came from ChriSenpai and sundays. I managed to figure out some coding myself and put "(me)" next to them since I deserve a little credit. If the coding doesn't have a name next to it, then it's from Bays.
